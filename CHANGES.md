### 0.2
- pass `--with-doc`, `--with-test` along in the generated bootstrap/install scripts
- check for bootstrapping prerequisites (`cc`, `make`, etc.) before starting
- fixed calls to `sudo`
- fixed escaping bugs on some versions of dash (and probably other shells too)
- fixed nested error messages
